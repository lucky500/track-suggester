* _Improve code as you see fit._



## Known Bugs

_On the last form Button is not closing as expected_
_Submit button also needs styling and it's supposed to hide once clicked_
_You are able to submit the form even without answering questions_
_App should prevent that behaviour and disable buttons or alert user to enter at least one answer_
_This site was way over engineered. The idea was to work with arrays and minimize code, but I guess it worked the other way around_
